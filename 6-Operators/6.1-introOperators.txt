what is operators ?

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical 
or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides 
the following types of operators âˆ’


Operators are.

1. Arithmetic operator.
2. Assigment operator.
3. Relational operator.
4. Logical operator
5. Conditional operator.
6. Unary operator.
7. Bitwise operator.
8. Special operator.

example : Arithmetic operators.

The arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
exponentiation, and modulus operations.

Addition	    +	Adds one operand to the other
Subtraction	    -	Subtracts the second operand from the first
Multiplication	*	Multiplies one operand by the other
Division	    /	Divides the first operand by the second
Modulo	        %	Divides the first INTEGER operand by the second, and returns the remainder
Exponentiation	**	Lets you refer to a number in terms of a base value and an exponent
