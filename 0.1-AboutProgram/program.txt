a set of instructions written in computer by (0,1) to solve a problen is called program.
computers can only execute their native machine instructions by (0,1)

transltor program.

A computer program in its human-readable form is called source code.
Source code needs another computer program to execute because,
computers can only execute their native machine instructions.
Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using the language's compiler.
(Assembly language programs are translated using an assembler.) The resulting file is called an executable.
Alternatively, source code may execute within the language's interpreter or compiler.so its called transltor 
program.
